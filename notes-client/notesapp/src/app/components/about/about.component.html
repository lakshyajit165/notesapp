            This app was created by me to learn the basics of JWT and implement containerization(as a refresher).
            It allows users to create, update, delete and filter through their scribbles. I got the idea from the fact that, 
            we all like to 'scribble' when in a boring lecture. So I thought, amidst this boring lockdown period, let me scribble 
            to distract my mind and have some fun!
